        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Boats Inc. was founded in 1868 with a clear idea of making the purchasing of yachts and other luxury boats
          more accessable for everyday people.
          The founders Olle Gordon, John Fredrik Maximilian Schürer von Waldheim and Telly Lange met one day by Lady
          Fate's calling, the three musketeers,
          Olle Gordon, John Fredrik Maximilian Schürer von Waldheim and Telly Lange, each brought their unique skills
          and passions to the table.
          Olle was a seasoned sailor with a deep love for the sea, John was a visionary entrepreneur with a knack for
          business, and Telly was a charismatic salesman
          with a gift for connecting with people from all walks of life.

          Driven by their shar ed vision of making luxury yachts more accessible, they pooled their resources and
          expertise to establish their company in 1868.
          Their mission was ambitious yet simple: to democratize the world of yachting and bring the joy of sailing to
          as many people as possible.
          Despite facing numerous challenges and skeptics along the way, the trio persevered, fueled by their unwavering
          determination and passion for their cause.
          They traveled the world, forging connections with shipbuilders, designers, and enthusiasts, and gradually
          built a reputation for themselves as pioneers in the industry.
          Today, the legacy of Olle, John, and Telly lives on, inspiring a new generation of sailors and enthusiasts to
          pursue their dreams of adventure on the open seas.
          And as their company continues to thrive, it remains a testament to the power of passion, perseverance, and
          the enduring spirit of exploration.
